Scale Up Web Infrastructure for [www.foobar.com](http://www.foobar.com)

Infrastructure Overview

This infrastructure splits the main components — web server, application server, and database — onto separate servers to improve scalability and maintainability. It also uses a HAProxy load balancer cluster for high availability.

Components and Roles

- Load Balancer (HAProxy Cluster):
  Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers. The cluster setup ensures if one load balancer fails, the other takes over (high availability).

- Web Server:
  Handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server. Having dedicated web servers offloads this work from the app servers.

- Application Server:
  Runs the business logic and processes application code. By separating it from the web server, you can scale or update the app server independently.

- Database Server:
  Dedicated server for the database (e.g., MySQL) storing all persistent data. Separating the database improves performance and security.


Why Add These Elements?

- Splitting Components:
  Improves scalability, fault isolation, and resource management. You can scale web or app servers independently based on demand.

- HAProxy Cluster:
  Prevents load balancer being a single point of failure (SPOF), ensuring continuous traffic distribution even if one load balancer fails.

- Dedicated Servers:
  Each server focuses on a single role, reducing resource contention and simplifying maintenance.

Summary

This advanced infrastructure is designed to handle increased traffic by scaling individual components independently and ensuring high availability through load balancer clustering.
