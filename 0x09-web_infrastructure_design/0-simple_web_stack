How it Works Step-by-Step

1. User visits [www.foobar.com](http://www.foobar.com) in their browser.

   * Browser asks DNS: “What is the IP address for [www.foobar.com?”](http://www.foobar.com?”)

2. DNS translates [www.foobar.com](http://www.foobar.com) to the server IP 8.8.8.8.

   * The www is an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8.

3. Browser sends HTTP request to IP 8.8.8.8.

   * The request arrives at the Nginx web server.

4. Nginx web server handles the request:

   * Serves static files directly.
   * For dynamic requests, forwards to the application server.

5. Application server runs your code, processes logic, and if needed, queries the MySQL database.

6. MySQL database stores website data and returns requested info.

7. Application server builds the response and passes it back to Nginx.

8. Nginx sends the final response to the user’s browser to render the website.

Key Concepts & Roles

* Server: The machine (physical or virtual) hosting your entire website infrastructure.
* Domain Name: Human-friendly address (foobar.com) that users type instead of IPs.
* DNS Record (www): An A record pointing [www.foobar.com](http://www.foobar.com) to IP 8.8.8.8.
* Web Server (Nginx): Receives requests, serves static files, forwards dynamic ones to the app server.
* Application Server: Runs the website code and handles business logic.
* Database (MySQL): Stores and manages persistent data for the website.
* Communication: Browser and server communicate over HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

Limitations of This Setup

* Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If this one server fails, the entire site goes offline.
* Downtime during Maintenance: Updating code or restarting services causes the site to be temporarily unavailable.
* No Scalability: One server can only handle limited traffic; high traffic leads to slowdowns or outages.
