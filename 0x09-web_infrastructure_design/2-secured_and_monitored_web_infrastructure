Explanation of Additional Elements and Their Roles

- Firewalls (3 total):
  Protect each server by controlling inbound and outbound traffic, blocking unauthorized access and potential attacks.

- SSL Certificate:
  Enables HTTPS to encrypt traffic between users and the server, protecting data from interception and tampering.

- Monitoring Clients (3 total):
  Collect metrics and logs from each server and send data to centralized monitoring services like SumoLogic for real-time analysis and alerting.

Why These Elements?

- Firewalls:
  Essential to secure servers from unwanted or malicious network traffic.

- HTTPS (SSL):
  Provides confidentiality and integrity for data exchanged over the internet, increasing user trust and meeting security best practices.

- Monitoring:
  Enables detection of performance issues, errors, and security breaches by continuously tracking server health, traffic, and application behavior.

How Monitoring Works

- Monitoring clients run on each server, collecting data such as CPU usage, memory, logs, and request rates.
- These clients send the data to a centralized monitoring platform (e.g., SumoLogic) for aggregation, visualization, and alerting.
- To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), configure monitoring tools to track the web serverâ€™s access logs or metrics endpoints that expose request counts.

Issues with This Infrastructure

- Terminating SSL at Load Balancer:
  The decrypted traffic inside the network may be exposed if the internal network is not secure, increasing risk.

- Single MySQL Server for Writes:
  The primary database node is a bottleneck and a SPOF; if it fails, write operations stop and the system cannot update data.

- Servers with All Components:
  Having database, web server, and application server on the same machines reduces modularity and scalability, complicates maintenance, and increases risk of resource contention.

This architecture improves security through firewalls and encrypted traffic, adds monitoring for reliability, but still needs enhancements in database redundancy, SSL termination security, and component separation for production readiness.
